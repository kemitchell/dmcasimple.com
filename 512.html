                  <li><!--(i)-->An order restraining the service provider from providing access to infringing material or activity residing at a particular online site on the provider's system or network.</li>

                  <li><!--(iii)-->Such other injunctive relief as the court may consider necessary to prevent or restrain infringement of copyrighted material specified in the order of the court at a particular online location, if such relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among the forms of relief comparably effective for that purpose.</li>

              <li>

              <li><!--(A)-->whether such an injunction, either alone or in combination with other such injunctions issued against the same service provider under this subsection, would significantly burden either the provider or the operation of the provider's system or network;</li>
              <li><!--(B)-->the magnitude of the harm likely to be suffered by the copyright owner in the digital network environment if steps are not taken to prevent or restrain the infringement;</li>
              <li><!--(C)-->whether implementation of such an injunction would be technically feasible and effective, and would not interfere with access to noninfringing material at other online locations; and</li>
              <li><!--(D)-->whether other less burdensome and comparably effective means of preventing or restraining access to the infringing material are available.</li>
