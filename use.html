    <h1>How to Use DMCASimple</h1>
    <p class="conspicuous">The DMCA Safe Harbor is a legal thing. Best case, you should find a lawyer who can ask about your situation and give you tailored advice. Contributors to this website, on the other hand, <a href="https://notlegaladvice.law">won’t be professionally responsible to you</a>, even if they practice law.</p>
    <p>The United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act">Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act</a>, which was passed as of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>, offers online service providers protection or “safe harbor” from some claims of copyright infringement. To get that protection, you need to meet the DMCA’s requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Qualify as an online “service provider” <a href=/statute#k1>as defined in the law</a>.</li>
      <li>Register <a href=/statute#c2>an agent</a> to receive copyright claims <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/dmca-directory/">through the United States Copyright Office</a>.</li>
      <li>Publish a policy, <a href=/1e>like DMCASimple</a>, about how you will handle copyright claims and repeat infringers.</li>
      <li>Follow your policy, as well as the law, when handling copyright claims.</li>
      <li>Not interfere with <a href=/statute#i2>“standard technical measures”</a> that copyright owners use to identify and protect their rights.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To use DMCASimple as the copyright policy for your website, create a copyright policy page with content based on the following template and link to it from the bottom of every page of your site. Make sure to replace all the {placeholders}.</p>
    <blockquote>
      We follow the DMCASimple copyright policy at <a href="https://dmcasimple.com/1e">https://dmcasimple.com/1e</a>.
      <p>The <dfn>website</dfn> is {address of your website, e.g. example.com}.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>operator</dfn> is {name of the person or company behind your website, e.g. "John Doe, resident of California" or "SomeCo, Inc., a New York corporation"}.</p>
      <p>Our <dfn>agent</dfn> is {e.g. "Able Agent, 123 Main Street, Oakland, CA 12345, agent@example.com, 555-555-5555"}.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The first paragraph uses a legal technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_by_reference">incorporation by reference</a>. The later paragraphs provide information that the policy needs to work.</p>
