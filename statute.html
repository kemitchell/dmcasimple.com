    <p>The United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act">Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act</a>, which was passed as of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>, offers online service providers protection or “safe harbor” from some claims of copyright infringement. The safe harbor law is codified in United States Code Title 17, Section 512. This page republishes the text of that section as of 2019, for easy reference.</p>
